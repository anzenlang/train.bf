# This repository

This repository contains material for the *anzenlang* Lean 4 introduction course. It is released
under the Mozilla Public License v2.0, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for more details.

Participants learn Lean 4 by writing an interpreter for (an extended version of) the [brainfuck]
language. The material is not self-sufficient to properly present Lean 4, it requires a trainer
guiding participants and presenting/adding context to every step of the process.

See [resources](#resources) for standalone Lean 4 learning material, in particular [Functional
Programming in Lean][fpil].



# Lean 4

- [Lean 4 on wikipedia][wikipedia]



## Brief history

- 2013: [Leonardo de Moura][leo] "releases" Lean 1

  compiler mostly in `C++`

- 2017: Lean 3, first *"stable"* version, still (very) experimental

  compiler still mostly `C++`

- 2021: Lean 4, first stable version

  compiler (eventually) almost completely written in Lean 4

- 2023: creation of the [Lean FRO][fro] to improve Lean 4 scalability and usability



## Description

- terminating, purely functional language

- strong, dependent type system

- great development language, also a great **I**nteractive **T**heorem **P**rover (ITP)

- heavily inspired by ML, Coq, and Haskell

- modern: (Rust-)cargo-like environment, utf-8-friendly, extremely clean syntax

  - `elan`: toolchain manager, fork of Rust's `rustup`
  - `lake`: project manager, pure Lean but based on Rust's `cargo`

- *efficient*
  - compiles to `C`
  - very clever [reference-counting-like memory management][immutable beans]



## "Basic" libraries

The Lean 4 community provides three "basic" packages/libraries:

- `core`: historically, contained only what the Lean compiler needs

  now transitioning to being a minimal standard library

  <https://github.com/leanprover/lean4>

- `batteries` (formerly `std`/`std4`): development-oriented standard library

  augments `core` with bells and whistles

  <https://github.com/leanprover/std4>

- `mathlib4`/`mathlib`: ITP standard library

  augments `core` and `batteries` with mostly theoretical definitions

  results from algebra, category theory, ...

  <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4>

Documentation for these libraries available here:

- <https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs>
